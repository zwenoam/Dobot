This folder includes all the functions that mighgt be called later in the mainscript to achieve certain goals:
rotk.m, hat.m, ve.m are the basic operations to project the geometrical vectors to the frames;
subproblem0.m, subproblem1.m, subproblem2.m, subproblem3.m, subproblem4.m are the subproblems we applied in the inverse kinematics;
fwdkin.m conduct the forward kinematics;
invkin.m conduct the inverse kinematics;
Verification_of_fwd_inv.m verifies the accuracy of the forward kinematics and the inverse kinematics;
